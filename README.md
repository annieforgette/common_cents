An automated system for delivering stocks reporting to groups of amateur contract traders. This system designed to automate the process of delivering reporting to group members in order to increase the transparency of the investment process and help aid in the group members understanding of investing. The system also aims to increase the productivity of the group administrator as he/she/they is no longer forced to spend time manually updating a spreadsheet to generate reporting for their group members.

Further documentation related to the conception of this idea and the development of this system can be found within the final report submitted alongside this project.
